      <h1 id="tandc-title">Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <p class="small"><strong>Effective date:</strong>24/11/2025</p>

      <p>Welcome to <strong>theBOAT</strong> ("Company", "we", "us", "our"). These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our software-as-a-service platform that provides sales analytics, inventory analytics, forecasting and related tools for ecommerce stores (including integrations with platforms such as Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce, and others) ("Service"). By creating an account, connecting a store, or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.</p>

      <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User / Customer:</strong> any person or entity that registers for or uses the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Data:</strong> data you provide or permit us to access from connected ecommerce platforms (orders, products, inventory, sales metrics, customer metadata, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Account:</strong> your credentials and profile used to access the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Acceptance & Eligibility</h2>
      <p>By using the Service you represent that you have authority to bind any entity on whose behalf you register, and that you are at least the minimum age required to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction. The Service is not intended for use by children under 13; we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

      <h2>3. Service Description</h2>
      <p>We provide analytics, dashboards, alerts, reports and forecasting features based on Store Data you choose to connect or upload. The specific integrations and features available may change from time to time. We may update, restrict, or discontinue features with notice as described in Section 17.</p>

      <h2>4. Your Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must have the right to authorize us to access any store or third-party account you connect. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account credentials.</li>
        <li>You will provide accurate billing and contact information and keep it up to date.</li>
        <li>You will comply with all applicable laws and platform terms (e.g., Shopify, Amazon) when using our Service.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for backing up any data you consider necessary; while we make reasonable efforts to preserve data, we are not responsible for data loss caused by your actions or third-party integrations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data Access & Use</h2>
      <p>By connecting a store or uploading files you grant us a license to access, store, and process that Store Data to provide the Service. We may aggregate and anonymize data across customers to improve features, provided individual customers cannot be identified. Our processing of personal data is governed by our <a href="/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2>6. Subscriptions, Fees & Billing</h2>
      <p>Access to the Service (or specific features) may require payment of fees. Billing terms, pricing, and billing cycles are set out on our pricing page or order form. You agree to pay all applicable fees. We may use third-party payment processors — your payment information will be handled by them per their terms.</p>

      <p class="small"><strong>Refunds:</strong> Refund and cancellation policies are described in the pricing or order documentation. Unless otherwise stated, payments are non-refundable.</p>

      <h2>7. Free Trials & Promotional Offers</h2>
      <p>Free trials, credits, or promotional offers (if any) are subject to additional terms and may require a credit card. We may terminate or modify promotional offers at any time.</p>

      <h2>8. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to misuse the Service. Prohibited activities include illegal activity, reverse engineering, interfering with the operation of the Service, exceeding permitted API usage, or attempting to access other accounts without authorization. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</p>

      <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>All rights, title and interest in the Service, its website, software, documentation and content (excluding Store Data and your content) remain with theBOAT and its licensors. You retain ownership of the Store Data and content you upload or connect, subject to the license you grant us to operate the Service.</p>

      <h2>10. Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>Each party will keep confidential information received from the other party and will not disclose it to third parties except as necessary to provide the Service, as required by law, or with the other party’s consent. Confidential information does not include information that is publicly known or independently developed.</p>

      <h2>11. Warranties & Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>We provide the Service "as is" and "as available" and disclaim all warranties to the fullest extent permitted by law. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or meet all your requirements. Where applicable law does not allow exclusion of implied warranties, those warranties apply but are limited in duration to 30 days from the date you first used the Service.</p>

      <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, theBOAT and its affiliates will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, or loss of profits, revenue, data, use, goodwill or other intangible losses. Our aggregate liability for direct damages will not exceed the amounts you paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim, or USD 100 if you paid nothing — whichever is greater.</p>

      <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless theBOAT, its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of your use of the Service, your breach of these Terms, or your violation of applicable law.</p>

      <h2>14. Termination</h2>
      <p>Either party may terminate for convenience by closing the account or ceasing use. We may suspend or terminate access immediately for breaches, abuse, or legal reasons. Upon termination, your right to access the Service ends; we may delete or anonymize your Store Data after a retention period stated in our Privacy Policy. Termination does not relieve you of your obligation to pay outstanding fees.</p>

      <h2>15. Third-Party Services & Integrations</h2>
      <p>The Service may integrate with third-party platforms (Shopify, Amazon, payment providers, hosting providers). Those platforms have separate terms and policies; you are responsible for complying with them. We are not responsible for third-party actions or outages.</p>

      <h2>16. Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (for example via email or a notice in the application). Continued use after the effective date of the updated Terms constitutes acceptance of the changes.</p>

      <h2>17. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Srilanka without regard to conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be resolved in the courts located in Sri Lanka, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue there, except where local law requires otherwise.</p>

      <h2>18. Miscellaneous</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms and any order forms or accepted quotes constitute the entire agreement between you and theBOAT regarding the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision is invalid, the remainder remains in effect.</li>
        <li><strong>No Waiver:</strong> Failure to enforce a right is not a waiver of that right.</li>
      </ul>
